# Machine-Learning
•	Implemented the K-nearest-neighbor algorithm with the k-fold cross validation technique to classify the given input data. The goal of this project was to generate an output grid along with the number of errors and the standard deviation that classifies all the points accurately. Language used: Java Implemented -  AdaBoosting and Real AdaBoosting algorithms the machine learning techniques which produce combined result of multiple “weak” classifiers into a single “strong” classifier for better classification on the testing data which has been implemented in Java
